                    <p>The Halloweentown Series consists of three games that were designed and built for a company Halloweentown party every year. The games are built in short time frames
                      that resemble "game jams" more then full production. The party itself hosts a much younger audience and therefore the games refelect that in mechanics and design.</p>
                      <p>For all of the Halloweentown games I acted as primary developer and sole designer. All the games are built in the Unity 3D game engine, use both VR and traditional controls, and can 
                        be downloaded via <a href="https://github.com/ThatAlexBoyd/">Github</a>.

                    <p>That is the strategy is running a taco empire in the simple game in which you buy various ingredients, decide what Mexican dishes you want to preapre, and then sell
                      them to customers for a hefty profit!</p>
                      <p> Taco Maker is a Python console game that I built over a few days to teach myself Python. As I taught myself the scripting language, I wanted an end goal to work towards
                        and the simple mechanics of the game were perfect for that. The full game can be downloaded via <a href="https://github.com/ThatAlexBoyd/Taco-Game">Github</a>.

                    <p>Simply put, I am trying (and to a degree succeeding) to build this website. I am not a web developer by trade, but in a world okay Wordpress themes I needed something
                      more. There are probably various things that are "incorrect" with this site if you pulled a senior full stack-developer, but it works. I learn something new each time
                      I decide to add something to this site, and for that reason it is worth it.

                          Guide your ship around the entire planet in search of the last of the aliens before another wave approaches!</p>
                          <p>Precious Defender is a mobile game that was developed using the Unity 3D game engine. All art assets were done by 3D artist Neil Jones, and I acted as the sole developer.
                            I had built Precious Commander when I was still learning Unity in 2012 and I consider it my first "real" game. Precious Commander can be donwloaded via the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.AlexBoyd.PreciousDefender">Google Play Store</a>.
